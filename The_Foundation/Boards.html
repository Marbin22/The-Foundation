    <h1> Program objectives </h1>
     <p> 
        1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges. 
        <br>
        2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic
        creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and manufacturing design.
        <br>
        3. Develop vision and sensing systems for use in robotic applications.
        <br>
        4. Integrate transducers, actuators, feedback and other mechanical systems into robotic platforms.
        <br>
        5. Apply examples of human and autonomous control systems into robotic platforms.
        <br>
        6. Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms
